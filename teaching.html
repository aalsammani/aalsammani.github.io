    <h2 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; font-size: 1.2em; text-align: justify;">
      My teaching philosophy in applied mathematics, data science, statistics, and machine learning is guided by a commitment to fostering deep conceptual understanding and promoting the ethical and responsible use of emerging technologies. I emphasize a strong theoretical foundation to empower students to tackle complex, real-world challenges confidently. My curriculum focuses on problem-solving, inquiry, and hands-on projects, utilizing real datasets and case studies from fields such as healthcare, economics, and environmental science. These examples showcase the practical relevance and power of analytical tools in addressing real-world issues.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; font-size: 1.2em;">
      In today’s digital landscape, I am dedicated to guiding students in the ethical integration of AI and machine learning tools. By encouraging critical thinking about data provenance, algorithmic fairness, and privacy considerations, I prepare students to be conscientious stewards of technology in society. This includes fostering awareness of the societal impacts of their analyses and promoting responsible decision-making.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; font-size: 1.2em;">
      With over a decade of teaching experience, I have worked with students from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds. My approach emphasizes active engagement and inclusivity, tailoring teaching methods to match course levels, class sizes, and individual needs. Through lectures, workshops, flipped classrooms, and collaborative projects, I ensure that students learn in ways best suited to them. I also provide ongoing support through regular office hours and responsive communication, fostering an environment where students feel valued and confident in seeking guidance.

    <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 2em; margin-top: 30px;">Teaching Approach</h3>
    <ul style="line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; font-size: 1.2em; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Encourage a Positive and Inclusive Learning Environment:</strong> I strive to create a welcoming atmosphere where students feel respected and supported, fostering trust and curiosity through approachable communication and active dialogue.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Provide Structured, Engaging Materials:</strong> Clear lecture notes, thoughtfully chosen examples, and real-world applications ensure students grasp concepts deeply while appreciating their practical value.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Promote Independent and Creative Thinking:</strong> I design activities that encourage intellectual curiosity and critical evaluation of algorithms and assumptions, helping students become forward-thinking problem-solvers.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Incorporate Technology and AI Thoughtfully:</strong> Hands-on exploration using statistical software, machine learning libraries, and ethical AI practices prepares students for real-world data challenges.</li>
      <li><strong style="color: #2c3e50;">Adapt to Diverse Needs and Backgrounds:</strong> I provide targeted support for students with varying academic preparation, ensuring inclusivity and fostering confidence across all learning levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #2c3e50; font-size: 2em; margin-top: 30px;">Teaching Experience</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; font-size: 1.2em;">
      At Jacksonville University (2022–present), I have taught courses such as Linear Algebra II, Data Science Foundations, Calculus III, and Probability Theory, integrating theoretical lessons with lab-based sessions using industry-standard tools. During my tenure at Auburn University (2014–2020), I instructed a wide array of courses, including Calculus I–III, Pre-Calculus, and College Algebra, excelling in various teaching formats (in-person, online, and hybrid). Earlier, at Al-Neelain University and the Academy of Engineering Sciences in Sudan, I taught Mathematical Analysis, Discrete Mathematics, and Numerical Methods, honing my adaptability in diverse classrooms.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: #34495e; font-size: 1.2em;">
      Across all teaching settings, I remain committed to fostering critical thinking, inclusivity, and high academic standards. My ultimate goal is to prepare students to thrive in a data-driven world with robust technical skills and ethical awareness.
